  {- Beyond this point, the ONLY change you should make is to change the comments so that the
     work you have completed is tested. DO NOT change anything other than comments (and indentation
     if needed). The comments in the template file are set up so that only the constant eight-off
     board from part 1 and the toFoundations function from part 1 are tested. You will probably
     want more than this tested.

     CHECK with Emma or one of the demonstrators if you are unsure how to change this.
